# Creating An Encrypted Iphone Backup with Finder

## Steps:

1. Launch Finder on your Mac running MacOS.

2. Connect your IPhone to your Mac.

3. Select your device from the list of devices located at the bottom of the left side bar labeled "locations".

4. In the General tab, select ```Back up all the data on your IPhone to this Mac``` from the options under the Backups section.

5. Check the box that says ```Encrypt local backup```. If this was your first time selecting this option, you may need to create a new password to unlock the encryption.

6. Click ```Back Up Now``` to start the back-up process.


The encrypted backup for your Iphone should now start. 

## Notes:

- Remember to keep the backup encryption password that you created safe, since without it you will not be able to access/modify/decrypt the backup file.
